CrimeCheck
==========




The Crime attack published in 2012 works against SSL Compression. 
It leverages a property of compression functions and can reveal to an attacker sensitive information being passed inside an encrypted SSL tunnel such as cookies.
This is a python based tool to check if the Web Server is vulnerable to the TLS/HTTP based Compression attacks or not.
